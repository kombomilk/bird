This project was done with the help of WebGL technology and jQuery javascript library. Two javascript libraries which were used here are Three.js(standard Webgl library) and jquery-1.5.1.min.js

== How can I see the picture?

Just run bird.html in Safari but be sure that you didn't change the project hierarchy and javascript libraries exist. Also, don't open this file from archive, extract the folder and then run bird.html.

== What to do if you see an empty page without any picture?

Maybe your browser doesn't support webgl which means that you're using IE<9. Just open bird.html in another browser and it should work.

== Who is that bird?

I've drawn my friend - Blacky bird, it's a blackbird. 
He likes flying at nights, eating worms and singing "Bye, bye, blackbird" by Peggy Lee but not Frank Sinatra version.
